# # Multi-GPU Mirrored Strategy
# 
# In this ungraded lab, you'll go through how to set up a Multi-GPU Mirrored Strategy. The lab environment only has a CPU but we placed the code here in case you want to try this out for yourself in a multiGPU device.
# 
# **Notes:** 
# - If you are running this on Coursera, you'll see it gives a warning about no presence of GPU devices. 
# - If you are running this in Colab, make sure you have selected your `runtime` to be `GPU`. 
# - In both these cases, you'll see there's only 1 device that is available.  
# - One device is sufficient for helping you understand these distribution strategies.

# ## Imports

# In[1]:


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os


# ## Setup Distribution Strategy

# In[2]:


# Note that it generally has a minimum of 8 cores, but if your GPU has
# less, you need to set this. In this case one of my GPUs has 4 cores
os.environ["TF_MIN_GPU_MULTIPROCESSOR_COUNT"] = "4"

# If the list of devices is not specified in the
# `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` constructor, it will be auto-detected.
# If you have *different* GPUs in your system, you probably have to set up cross_device_ops like this
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(cross_device_ops=tf.distribute.HierarchicalCopyAllReduce())
print ('Number of devices: {}'.format(strategy.num_replicas_in_sync))


# ## Prepare the Data

# Adding a dimension to the array -> new shape == (28, 28, 1)
# We are doing this because the first layer in our model is a convolutional
# layer and it requires a 4D input (batch_size, height, width, channels).
# batch_size dimension will be added later on.
